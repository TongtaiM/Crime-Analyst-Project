# About This Project
This is for my final group project in my university. I was responsible for writing most of the code. We work with massive dataset containing 2 million crime cases in Los Angeles.

- This project harnesses the power of crime data to gain a deeper understanding of crime patterns in Los Angeles. By analyzing this data,   we developed prediction models to cope address crime issues.
- This dataset had many missing and some invalid columns, requiring extensive cleaning and preparation.
- We employed K-modes clustering in R and two-step clustering in SPSS to cluster crime cases and gain a deeper understanding of crime patterns.
- After clustering, we were able to group similar crime cases and create a new variable named "crime group".
- We test which independent variable are associate to crime group.
- Then we performed EDA on each crime group, uncovering valuable insights from each popular crime category.
- Unlike many crime prediction projects that focus on when and where crimes will occur, we took a different approach.
- We developed a classification model to predict which crime group will occur to victim.
- This project utilizes dplyr, ggplot2, and other machine learning library.
