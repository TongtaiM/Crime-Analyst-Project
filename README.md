This project is focusing in classification type of crime from crime data in los angleles

## My Project following this step
### 1. Clean data
Identifile and cleaning  Missing,outlier,Duplicate data
### 2. Recode
- Recode some date variable into categorical variable
- Recode some numberic variable into categorical variable
### 3. Clustering
Clustering crime data with k-mode algorithm to see which crime type have samilar arttibute and identifie group_crime_type to predict
The reason i use k-mode algorithm is because own crime data have too many categorycal data
### 4. Modeling
Other file is about split data fitting model(decisiontree,KNN,Navie Bay,Cat Boost) and evaluate
